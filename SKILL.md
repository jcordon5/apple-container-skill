  Expert guidance for Apple's `container` CLI — the open-source tool that runs Linux
  containers and persistent Linux "container machines" as lightweight VMs on Apple
  silicon Macs (an alternative to Docker Desktop / Colima / Lima / OrbStack). Use this
  skill WHENEVER the user wants to run, build, or manage Linux containers or a Linux
  dev environment on a Mac and is using — or could use — Apple `container`. Trigger on:
  "Apple container", "container CLI", "run a container on my Mac without Docker",
  "container machine", "Linux VM on Mac silicon", "correr un contenedor en mi Mac",
  "máquina/entorno Linux en Mac", "instalar container de Apple", `container run`,
  `container build`, `container machine create`, `container system start`, publishing
  ports, volumes, networks, or registries with this tool, or porting a Docker/`docker run`
  workflow to Apple `container`. Also use it to diagnose why containers, ports, DNS, or
  networking misbehave on macOS. Do NOT use it for Docker Desktop/Podman/Kubernetes-specific
  questions, or for plain Dockerfile authoring that has nothing to do with running on a Mac.

# Apple `container` expert

`container` is Apple's open-source CLI (Swift, Apple-silicon-native) that runs **each
Linux container inside its own lightweight virtual machine**, and consumes/produces
standard OCI images. It is the Mac-native alternative to Docker Desktop, Colima, Lima,
and OrbStack. Repo: https://github.com/apple/container — latest release line: 1.x.

Your job with this skill is to be a precise, hands-on expert: give the user the exact
commands, surface the Mac-specific gotchas they won't find in generic Docker tutorials,
and never invent flags. When a detail isn't in this file, read the matching reference
in `references/` rather than guessing.

## The one mental model that explains everything

`container` is **not** Docker-on-a-shared-VM. Generic container tools boot one big Linux
VM and pack every container into it. `container` boots a **separate micro-VM per
container**. Internalize this because it explains nearly every difference a Docker user
will trip over:

- **Isolation & security** come from the VM boundary, so each container is strongly isolated.
- **`0.0.0.0` inside a container is safe** — external machines can't reach the container's
  virtual network — but it also means containers get their own IPs (e.g. `192.168.64.3`)
  rather than sharing the host's localhost by default. Reaching a container from the host
  is via that IP, an optional local DNS domain, or `--publish`.
- **Memory is allocated per VM** and (today) freed memory isn't fully returned to macOS;
  long-lived memory-heavy containers may need an occasional restart.
- Two products share the engine: **containers** (app-shaped, usually ephemeral) and
  **container machines** (persistent Linux environments). Pick the right one — see below.

## CRITICAL: check the macOS version first — it gates real functionality

`container` is *designed for and supported on macOS 26+*. It runs on macOS 15 but with
limitations the maintainers will not fix. Before giving networking-heavy advice, know
which the user is on (`sw_vers -productVersion`). On **macOS 15**:

- The `container network` subcommands are **unavailable**; `--network` on `run`/`create`
  errors. Every container attaches to the single `default` vmnet network.
- **Container-to-container networking does not work** — containers are isolated from each
  other on the virtual network (this breaks the "curl one container from another" pattern).
- Container IP assignment is fragile (the network is created when the first container
  starts), so containers can occasionally come up with no network.
- Use `--publish` to reach a service from the host; don't rely on container DNS or
  cross-container calls.

On **macOS 26+** all of the above works: user-defined isolated networks, container-to-
container traffic, stable IPs. When the user is on 15 and wants multi-container networking,
tell them plainly that it needs macOS 26 — don't hand them commands that will fail.

## Step 0 — is it installed and running?

Almost every task fails at the same place: the tool isn't installed or the system service
isn't started. Check, and guide setup, before anything else:

```bash
command -v container && container --version    # installed?
container system status                         # service up?
```

- **Not installed:** download the signed `.pkg` from
  https://github.com/apple/container/releases (latest 1.x), double-click, enter admin
  password (installs under `/usr/local`). Requires an Apple-silicon Mac.
- **Installed but not started:** `container system start`. On first run it offers to
  download a recommended Linux kernel — accept it (`Y`) or the engine has nothing to boot.
- Upgrades/downgrades go through `/usr/local/bin/update-container.sh` (stop the service
  first with `container system stop`). Uninstall: `/usr/local/bin/uninstall-container.sh`
  (`-k` keeps user data, `-d` deletes it).

Don't fabricate a Homebrew formula or a `brew install container` line — the supported path
is the signed installer. If you can't verify the install, say so and give the install steps.

## Decision: container vs. container machine

This is the most important choice you'll help the user make. Get it right and the rest
follows.

| Use a **container** (`container run`) when… | Use a **container machine** (`container machine create`) when… |
|---|---|
| Running a service or app: a web server, Postgres, Redis, a build job | You want a **persistent Linux dev environment** that survives stop/start |
| The unit of work is *one application* | The unit of work is *a Linux box* you live in |
| You want it ephemeral (`--rm`) or detached (`-d`) | You want your **Mac `$HOME` mounted in** and your **host user**, not root |
| You're reproducing a datacenter workload locally | You want to edit code in a Mac IDE and compile/run inside Linux, or run real services under `systemd`/`init` |

A container machine boots the image's **init system**, maps your **username and home
directory** into Linux, and persists its filesystem. It's the answer to "I want a Linux
machine on my Mac," not "I want to run nginx." Full guide: `references/container-machines.md`.

## Core workflows (the 80%)

### Run a container

```bash
# interactive shell
container run -it --rm ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

# detached service, publish a host port to the container port
container run -d --name web -p 8080:80 --rm nginx:latest

# resources, env, and a persistent named volume
container run -d --name db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret \
  --cpus 4 --memory 4G \
  -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
```

Defaults per container: 4 CPUs, 1 GiB RAM (overridable with `--cpus`/`--memory` or in
`config.toml`). `--rm` removes the container on exit; `-d` detaches; `-it` gives an
interactive TTY. Reach a detached service from the host via the published port
(`localhost:8080`) or the container's IP (`container ls` shows it).

### Build an image

```bash
container build -t my-app:latest .                       # Dockerfile or Containerfile in .
container build -f docker/Dockerfile.prod -t my-app:prod .
container build --arch arm64 --arch amd64 -t my-app .     # multi-platform (amd64 runs via Rosetta)
```

The first build silently starts a **builder VM** (BuildKit, 2 CPU / 2 GiB by default).
For heavy builds, pre-size it: `container builder start --cpus 8 --memory 16G`. To resize a
running builder you must `container builder stop && container builder delete` then start it
again.

### Create a container machine

```bash
container machine create alpine:latest --name dev      # boots it
container machine run -n dev                            # shell as YOUR host user, $HOME mounted
container machine run -n dev -- uname -a                # run one command
container machine set-default dev                       # then drop -n
container machine set -n dev cpus=4 memory=8G           # takes effect after stop+start
```

### Manage what's running

```bash
container ls -a                 # list (default: running only; -a includes stopped)
container exec -it web sh       # shell into a running container
container logs -f web           # follow stdout; add --boot for VM/init boot logs
container stats                 # live top-like resource view
container stop web && container rm web
container system df             # disk used by images/containers/volumes
```

## Going deeper — read the reference that matches the task

Keep this file as the map; load the detail on demand so you stay accurate instead of
recalling flags from memory:

- **`references/command-reference.md`** — the complete CLI surface: every subcommand,
  flag, and argument for `run`/`create`/`build`/`exec`/`image`/`network`/`volume`/
  `registry`/`machine`/`system`/`builder`, with the exact option formats (mount syntax,
  `--publish` spec, capabilities, `--ulimit`, etc.). Go here whenever you need a precise
  flag or aren't 100% sure one exists.
- **`references/container-machines.md`** — persistent Linux dev environments: lifecycle,
  home-mount modes, bring-your-own image (systemd-enabled Dockerfile), the
  `/etc/machine/create-user.sh` first-boot hook, and the VS Code remote workflow.
- **`references/networking-storage.md`** — publishing ports (IPv4/IPv6), user-defined
  networks (macOS 26+), local DNS domains, reaching a host service from a container,
  custom MAC addresses, `--ssh` agent forwarding, named/anonymous volumes and ext4
  journaling, and bind mounts.
- **`references/config-and-troubleshooting.md`** — `~/.config/container/config.toml`
  schema (default CPU/RAM, registry domain, DNS domain, kernel, subnets), Rosetta toggle,
  nested virtualization, the memory-ballooning caveat, and a symptom→fix troubleshooting
  table (including the macOS 15 networking failures).

## How to behave as this expert

- **Verify before prescribing.** When relevant, check install state, service status, and
  macOS version rather than assuming. A command that errors because the service is down
  wastes the user's time and trust.
- **Don't invent flags or a Homebrew install.** If you're unsure a flag exists, open
  `references/command-reference.md`. The supported install is the signed `.pkg`.
- **Translate Docker honestly.** `container run` mirrors `docker run` closely (`-it`,
  `-d`, `-p`, `-v`, `-e`, `--rm`, `--name` all work), so port Docker commands directly —
  but call out the real differences: per-container VMs, per-container IPs, the macOS-26
  networking gate, no Docker-Compose (run/script the services yourself), and anonymous
  volumes that do **not** auto-remove with `--rm`.
- **Pick container vs. machine deliberately** and say why in one line, so the user learns
  the distinction instead of just getting commands.
- **Prefer copy-pasteable command blocks** with brief inline explanation over prose. Show
  the cleanup step (`stop`/`rm`/`prune`) when you start something long-lived.
